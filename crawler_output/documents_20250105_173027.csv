"Find Shelter Overview HOST is activating 24/7 cold weather shelter from 1 p.m. Monday, Dec. 30 through 11 a.m. Wednesday, Jan. 8 at the Stone Creek shelter (former Best Western hotel), 4595 Quebec St. and at city facilities located at 2601 W. 7 th Ave., and 375 S. Zuni St. In addition, extra overflow shelter is open from 8 p.m. to 7 a.m. at the St. Charles Recreation Center, 3777 Lafayette St. through Jan. 6. Additional overflow shelter may be added on Jan. 6 and updates will be provided on this page. Individuals in need of shelter are encouraged to go to “front door” shelter access points: • For individual men – Denver Rescue Mission Lawrence Street Community Center, 2222 Lawrence St. • For individual women – Samaritan House, 2301 Lawrence St. • For youth ages 15-20 – Urban Peak, 1630 S. Acoma St. • Families in need of shelter should call the Connection Center at 303-295-3366. A printable flier of this information is available here. (PDF, 167KB) The Department of Housing Stability (HOST) partners with many agencies citywide to provide shelter for people experiencing homelessness. There are many shelter facilities throughout the city, so rather than requiring people in crisis to navigate a complex system, we have identified specific centrally-located facilities as the “front door” access to the entire system. These locations have longer hou rs for intake and have transportation available to other facilities. They can also help people navigate which shelter facility is the best option for their individual situation. HOST is now offering a free circulator bus service for persons experiencing homelessness from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. See the route, stops, and services here (PDF, 97KB) / en español (PDF, 90KB) . See also this list of rider expectations (PDF, 47KB) / en español (PDF, 51KB) . Walk-up Shelter Access & “Front Door” Referral Centers If you or someone you know is in housing crisis and needs shelter urgently, please refer them to “front door” facilities, where we offer both walk-up access and have the ability to refer (and sometimes transport) to other shelters as appropriate. Walk-up only centers do not refer to other facilities. Find this information in printable form here.

See the Save Haven site for more information. Other Shelter Facilities These providers are also part of Denver’s shelter network, but do not transport to other facilities, and are therefore not recommended “front door” entry points. Locations listed here without an address are NOT walk-up facilities. Delores Project: women and transgender individuals, (303) 534-5411, beds are assigned only by phone at 10 a.m. daily Day Centers and Supportive Services These facilities are available for people to access during daytime business hours listed, but are NOT overnight shelters.

The alternatives include options for couples, people with pets, transgender individuals, people with health conditions, people who are recovering from COVID, families, people living in a vehicle, and other extenuating circumstances. These programs are limited and have waiting lists, and are NOT walk-up accessible. To access these programs, please work with an outreach worker or case manager at one of the “front door” shelters or a day center for a referral.

Lunch served 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Access Points Throughout Metro Denver Access Points are locations where those experiencing homelessness can access Metro Denver’s Coordinated Entry System (CES). The purpose of Coordinated Entry is to ensure that people experiencing homelessness have equitable access to the housing resources they need to resolve their housing crisis. You can find all the Metro Denver Access Points here. Severe Weather Shelter Plans Severe weather poses a serious danger to those staying outside, and we encourage people to come inside. HOST, alongside shelter and outreach partners, monitors weather and shelter usage to activate severe weather protocols and shelter expansions as necessary. The City’s Emergency Operations Plan calls for the opening of recreation centers as warming locations during regular business hours, and additional overnight shelter to ensure capacity for everyone to come inside when temperatures are unsafe. The Denver Department of Public Health & Environment (DDPHE) is the lead agency in monitoring weather conditions and determining when temperatures indicate a need for severe weather activation. So that people in crisis do not have to figure out where shelter is available, people in need of shelter should be referred to the city’s “front door” shelter access points and will be transported to overnight shelter. If additional overflow shelter is activated, a banner will appear on the denvergov.org website and additional information will be posted at the top of this page. 2024-2025 Severe Weather Shelter Plan (PDF, 309KB) Related Links You May Also Find Helpful Contact 3-1-1 Report an Issue Call 3-1-1 Outside Denver: (720) 913-1311 Hearing Impaired Only (TTY): (720) 913-8479 For Emergencies: 9-1-1 Visit Other Denver Sites Share & Connect The Denver Local is your resource for city news and information directly to your inbox.

"Colorado Open Records Act The City and County of Denver is committed to making city government open, accountable and accessible to the public. The City’s approach to the Colorado Open Records Act (CORA) is an important part of its pledge to transparency to build trust with our residents. These guidelines help City agencies and departments provide the public with efficient access to documents and records pursuant to the Colorado Revised Statutes, C.R.S. §24-72-205(6). Making a Records Request Requesters must submit a request to the agency that is the custodian of the record itself. The City does not maintain a central repository for public records or a single office that fulfills requests. Please visit the City Directory online for a list of department webpages for each City agency to request and obtain records. You will find information on how to make a CORA request on the agencies' Contact page. For further information, contact the agency directly to ask how to submit a CORA request. PLEASE NOTE: A CORA request received after 3 p.m. or any day that the agency is officially closed will be considered received on the following working day. CORA Costs To pay for the cost of processing a CORA request, the agency may charge for the time spent to research and respond to requests for records under CORA. Time and Cost Estimates Agencies may provide the requester with a time and cost estimate, which may require a pre-payment before processing the request. If you pay for more time than is spent processing your request, you will receive a refund. Document Format Documents may be available in their native format if they do not need to be redacted or if they can be readily accessed. Documents such as databases or spreadsheets that can be sorted or searched will be available in a similar format. The City will not provide documents in a format that requires providing software or that would violate the terms of any agreement or rights held by a third party, such as licensing agreements or copyrights.

"Neighborhood Inspections In order to protect the safety, health, and welfare of all residents, city regulations require that property owners keep their properties safe and well-maintained. To accomplish this task, Denver has roughly two dozen ""zoning and neighborhood inspectors"" (Z/NIS), who handle public education and code enforcement throughout the city's 155 square miles. Items intended for outdoor use on a residential property such as picnic tables, children's toys and bicycles are allowed to be kept outdoors. Items intended for indoor use such as upholstered furniture and household appliances may not be stored outside. Tools, equipment and supplies utilized for automobile repair or construction may not be stored outside. Parking on dirt areas is not allowed. Allowable parking surfaces for single-family dwellings include 6 inches of gravel, road base material (recycled asphalt), asphalt, or concrete. Allowable parking surfaces for 2-unit dwellings or multi-unit dwellings include road base, asphalt, or concrete. Denver households are allowed one vehicle per licensed driver, plus one extra vehicle. For example, a household consisting of three licensed drivers may have up to four vehicles at the residence. Additional cars would be considered in violation of the code. Plant growth may not extend onto adjacent sidewalks, streets or alleys, or block visibility at street corners. Fences must be maintained, built to proper height (generally 4’ in the front and 6’ in the sides and back of residential lots), and constructed with approved materials (no barbed wire, corrugated metal or salvage materials). Check to see whether your fence requires a permit . Denver’s city ordinance requires that property owners keep sidewalks clear at all times. After snow has stopped falling, inspectors begin enforcement — checking for snowy/icy sidewalks in business areas the same day and residential areas the following day. Parking or storing inoperable motor vehicles in any residential zone district is restricted to one vehicle that must be stored inside an enclosed garage. A vehicle that is not operable cannot be stored on the street or in a driveway of a home. Residents may have one yard sale every six months in Denver, provided that the sale lasts for less than 72 hours, items offered for sale were not bought for resale or received on consignment for the purpose of resale, and all external evidence of the sale is removed immediately afterward. Home occupations are allowed in Denver. The business must be operated by the resident in a completely enclosed structure, the primary dwelling unit or a detached accessory structure as allowed by the zoning code. The home occupation shall not display or create outside the building any external evidence of its operation. A sign of up to 100 square inches in size is allowed. See the Project Guide for Home Businesses for information . The Denver Zoning Code regulates how many household pets can be part of a home residence. Violations occur when the number of household pets exceeds 2 rabbits, 25 pigeons, 2 domestic honey bee hives, or more than 5 dogs and cats combined (you cannot have more than 3 dogs as part of the combined total). Most construction projects require a zoning permit and may also require a building permit. For example, construction of fences, sheds, and gazebos all require zoning permits and depending on their design require a building permit too. Check the requirements for your project under Single-Family and Duplex Projects . More Information Have questions? City staff will have standing availability on Thursdays to help answer questions about code violations in your Denver neighborhood.

These guidelines help City agencies and departments provide the public with efficient access to documents and records pursuant to the Colorado Revised Statutes, C.R.S. §24-72-205(6). Making a Records Request Requesters must submit a request to the agency that is the custodian of the record itself.

Get funding to make your next project all-electric too! 2022 Building Code Updates Denver worked for over 18 months to develop a new building and fire code. In January 2023, Denver City Council adopted the 2022 Denver Building and Fire Code and the 2022 Denver Green Code. These new codes apply to all new construction, remodels, and building renovations. The codes also provide pathways for building projects to be more efficient and comfortable. The building code is based on the 2021 series of international codes. It also includes local amendments tailored to Denver’s unique climate, context, and goals. The 2022 Denver Building and Fire Code and 2022 Denver Green Code are effective as of May 1, 2023 . 2022 Denver Energy Code High-Level Overview Denver Building Regulations Timeline Below is a timeline of electrification and building performance-related goals and requirements for new and existing buildings and homes in Denver. Note: this graphic is intended to be a high-level visual aid. For more detailed information on requirements, visit the corresponding webpages: Why does Denver have the goal for all new buildings and homes to achieve Zero Emissions by 2030? Greenhouse gas emissions trap heat and contribute to climate change. Buildings and Homes are responsible for 64% of Denver’s the air-polluting greenhouse gas emissions. However, a building or home that is Zero Emissions does not contribute to greenhouse gas emissions once the local grid is decarbonized. Zero Emissions new buildings are: Xcel Energy provides all the electricity that Denver purchases. Xcel Energy is on track to reduce carbon emissions from their electrical grid by 85% by 2030 by producing electricity with renewables, such as solar and wind. Since Zero Emissions new buildings and homes are all-electric, these buildings only use only electricity to heat, cool, and operate. They do not rely on the use of fossil fuels. These all-electric buildings can take advantage of the work Xcel Energy is doing to create a cleaner renewable grid. This is not the case if the building still uses natural gas or other fossil fuels. The chart below shows Xcel Energy’s grid moving towards lower carbon emissions by 2030. This is known as ""decarbonizing the grid."" The closer the line gets to 100% carbon emission reduction, the less greenhouse gas emissions Colorado’s grid produces. Through Senate Bill 19-236, the Colorado Legislature has required electric utilities to decarbonize the electric grid by 80% by 2030.  Xcel Energy has voluntarily exceeded that target and filed a plan that achieves at least an 85% emissions reduction by 2030. There are also many additional benefits to Zero Emissions homes and buildings, such as: How Do We Make Buildings All-Electric? Heat pumps are a part of the solution. More efficient all-electric heating and cooling equipment, like heat pumps, are available. Heat pumps: Cold climate heat pumps are readily available. Cold climate heat pumps can maintain a higher efficiency and capacity at lower temperatures and work great in Colorado’s climate. They can maintain more than 70% of their capacity at temperatures as low as 5°F.  And many can operate effectively even when it is -10 degrees Fahrenheit outside.

"Average Plan Review Times The ability to estimate permitting timelines is an important factor in managing your project. While we strive to provide accurate estimates based on current 90-day averages, actual review times may vary by project. Community Planning and Development is committed to monitoring and sharing review times and making adjustments as needed to provide excellent quality of work and customer service for all projects. Some projects will have a due date listed in e-permits. These dates are set automatically based on target review times, and do not adjust in response to volume or capacity. For a more accurate estimate, please use the dates provided in the dashboard below based on when your permit application was accepted for review. Projects are reviewed in the order they are received by the next available staff member. E-permits will not list a specific reviewer for your project until one is available and the project has been officially picked up for review by that individual. Q2 Update: Mayor's Goal to Reduce Permitting Time On July 15, 2024, Mayor Mike Johnston, joined by Denver Community Planning and Development and other city agencies, announced that the city has cut bureaucratic red tape and streamlined processes to exceed Mayor Johnston’s goal of cutting residential permitting times by 30 percent and is on track to reduce commercial permitting times by 30 percent by the end of the year. Previous efforts combined with current innovations and initiatives are helping the city make progress in meeting the mayor’s goal by the end of 2024. This progress reflects steps the city took several months ago to reduce the backlog in permit review times. Community Planning and Development has also met with several city stakeholders, including the Downtown Denver Partnership and developers, to collect feedback and act on solutions. Staff have been focused on driving the improvements and will continue to do so. The city also recognizes that these timelines can still fluctuate if other variables are at play. Changes in permit application volumes, staffing levels, and market activity have the potential to affect plan review timelines positively or negatively before the end of 2024. Throughout the year, the city will continue to monitor progress and prioritize solutions that will help us achieve the permitting timeline goals.

"2023 Sanitary Sewer Master Plan Overview The City and County of Denver Sanitary Sewer Master Plan (SSMP)
is a living document that evaluates Denver’s sanitary sewer capacity and level of service. It provides guidance on capacity improvement needs to maintain an appropriate level of service to residents and businesses and support the growth in the City. North Denver Sanitary Sewer, Circa 1910-1920 Photo courtesy of Denver Public Library, Western History Collection Sewer crew laying clay line in trench, 1923 Photo courtesy of Denver Public Library, Western History Collection Sewer pipe sections and wooden forms, Circa 1909 Photo courtesy of Denver Public Library, Western History Collection Background The City’s sanitary sewer system covers approximately 155 square miles of land area and provides services to over 730,000 people. As shown in Figure 1, the sanitary sewer system is an underground system that collects sanitary flows from residences and businesses, where it is then transported to the Metro Water Recovery’s Robert W. Hite Treatment Facility for treatment.  The City-owned and operated sanitary sewer system consists of 7 lift stations, 10 miles of sanitary sewer force mains, and over 1,500 miles of gravity sewer pipe network ranging in size from 6 to 60-inches. The City has provided sanitary sewer service for over 150 years and has conducted multiple Sanitary Sewer Master Plans (SSMPs) over the last 70 years, starting in 1950 with the most recent SSMP completed in 2023. The 2023 update is built upon the prior master plans and the current design criteria, while leveraging the advancement in hydraulic modeling to evaluate the system in a comprehensive way. It provides guidance to capacity improvements to maintain an appropriate level of service to existing and future residents and businesses in the City’s sanitary sewer system area. Authorization The City commissioned this master plan as an update to the 2009 SSMP to provide a digital master plan that utilizes the most up-to-date flow monitoring and hydraulic modeling practices. It provides a clear understanding of the existing level of service as well as a high-level, conceptual snapshot of the 2050 planning horizon that align with the land use and growth projections as anticipated in the City’s Blueprint Denver (Denveright) and Denver Moves Everyone plans. Intent This SSMP document is a high-level citywide planning tool that aims to analyze and evaluate Denver’s existing sanitary sewer flows, provides guidance on the capacity improvements to maintain appropriate level of service to residents and businesses, and support the growth in the City. While the SSMP did not provide prioritization of the recommended improvements, it did provide the technical data required to develop projects to support the City’s data-driven decision making. Project prioritization occurs by the City during the City’s 6-Year Capital Improvement Program (CIP), which incorporate a wide variety of factors such as equity and regulatory compliance in addition to all technical data developed from the SSMP. The CIP not only considers the SSMP recommendations, but also takes other identified infrastructure needs into consideration within the City to leverage available funding in order to achieve multiple benefits when it is possible. Figure 1. Sanitary versus Stormwater Process The 2023 SSMP update process began with research and data collection, identifying data quality issues for successful hydraulic model construction. Next steps included hydraulic model development, hydraulic model calibration and validation, flow projection, system performance evaluation, and the production of prioritization toolsets to guide future improvements. This resulted in a fully digital master plan that is adaptive and can be used for years to come. Approach The approach for this SSMP update includes the following key tasks: Data Collection: Collection of as-builts and GIS data to support the construction of a fully dynamic hydraulic model. A flow monitoring project was conducted as part of the SSMP to monitor the flowrates in the City’s sanitary sewer system across the entire service area, capturing dry weather and wet weather flows to serve as the basis to guide hydraulic model calibration. Hydraulic Model: A comprehensive hydraulic model was constructed to dynamically model the City’s sanitary sewer system and serve as the tool to evaluate the system performance and identify improvement needs to meet the current and future needs. The model was calibrated to the current observed flowrates to ensure the simulated flow rates is well represented across the City’s entire sewer system. System Evaluations: The master plan evaluated the existing Level of Service (LOS) provided to residents and business across the City based on hydraulic modeling results. The master plan also evaluated how the future growth in the City (based on regional and Denver specific planning datasets) may impact the sanitary sewer infrastructure, and identified potential improvements that may be required to support the growth. Master Plan: A comprehensive documentation of all tasks completed as part of the master planning effort, as well as digital deliverables including hydraulic models, GIS database, and numerous toolsets developed to support CIP planning.

"Expanding Housing Affordability Ordinance and Affordable Housing Fee Overview You may notice this page looks different! When the Expanding Housing Affordability (EHA) ordinance became effective on July 1, 2022, it updated the affordable housing linkage fee (established in 2017 for many development types) and created new affordable housing requirements for developments of 10 or more new dwelling units. As of July 1, 2022, all application projects will be prompted in e-permits to demonstrate how they meet the requirements of Denver’s Expanding Housing Affordability ordinance. About the EHA Ordinance The Expanding Housing Affordability ordinance will create more affordable housing options for our workforce as well as increase funding for Denver’s Affordable Housing Fund. There are three core elements: Read about the history of the Expanding Housing Affordability ordinance >> Complying with the EHA Ordinance Residential developments of 10 units or more may fulfill the ordinance requirements by: All other development types are required to pay the updated linkage fee. Please note that mixed-use developments that include 10 or more residential units must meet the mandatory affordable housing requirement for the residential portion and pay the linkage fee for the non-residential portion. Linkage Fee - Starting July 1, 2022 The linkage fee went into effect in 2017 as one funding source of a dedicated affordable housing fund in Denver. The affordable housing fund is used to create and preserve thousands of affordable homes for low-to-moderate income families. The Expanding Housing Affordability ordinance became effective July 1, 2022 and increases linkage fees for non-residential development and residential development of 9 or fewer units. For mixed-use buildings containing 10 or more dwelling units, the non-residential portion of the building must pay the linkage fee unless it is a ground-floor commercial, sale, or service use that is eligible for an exception per the incentives or is eligible for another exception. To find out if your project is exempt from the Expanding Housing Affordability ordinance's updated linkage fee schedule, view the ordinance's effective dates . If your project is exempt, proceed to this page . Linkage fees are due prior to issuance of a building permit, except in cases of excavation and shoring. Fee schedule Updated July 2022 Current Fee Schedule Fee changes are published here and in the building permit fee policy (PDF, 162KB) . Height and Floor Area Incentives for Enhanced Linkage Fees To encourage commercial employment grown in downtown and urban areas near transit while providing additional funding for affordable housing, the Denver Zoning Code provides incentives for commercial projects in certain circumstances. Applicability: Projects with zone lots ½ mile of a rail transit station platform, using the general or shopfront building form and are located in an C-RX, C-MX or C-MS zone district or is within a D-C, D-TD, D-GT, or D-AS zone districts AND are a non-residential structure (meaning that the primary residential uses are less than 50% or less of the gross floor area, excluding parking) may pay 2 times the linkage fee for the entirety of the project and may develop to the maximum height with incentives set forth in the applicable building form table or section within Article 8 (PDF, 25MB) for the downtown districts. Example of a Commercial Development Accessing Incentives A commercial project in the D-GT zone district has a base floor area ratio (FAR) of 8.0. If the applicants want to build from 8.1 to the maximum of 15.0 FAR, they must pay two times the applicable linkage fee at the time of building permit. If they applied for a building permit in December of 2023 and opted to build to 12 FAR, they would pay a fee of $10.84psf (fee of $5.42X 2) for the entire development (excluding parking). Exceptions The following exceptions to the linkage fee may be submitted, and they can be found in the Denver Revised Municipal Code Sec. 27-154. The required documentation at time of site development plan (SDP) is provided below. Exceptions must be approved prior to SDP approval. Reductions and Waivers The Expanding Housing Affordability ordinance requires the payment of a linkage fee for all new development except new residential development of 10 or more units that is subject to the mandatory affordable housing requirement. The Executive Director of the Department of Housing Stability may reduce or waive the amount of the linkage fees that would otherwise be imposed. Any applicant requesting a reduction or waiver must demonstrate that the required fee exceeds the amount needed to mitigate the actual demand for affordable housing created by the development. Request a reduction or waiver (coming soon) About the Affordable Housing Fund Denver's housing costs, both for-rent and for-sale, have risen dramatically since 2010. Even with robust construction, Denver's supply of housing is unable to keep pace with demand. The community asked the city to address the struggle faced by 1/3 of Denver households that are housing cost-burdened (paying more than one-third of their monthly income on housing) by establishing a dedicated fund. The housing fund is used to create and preserve housing for households across a wide income spectrum. The fund will support permanent housing and supportive services for at-risk residents, low- and moderate-income workforce rental housing, and moderate-income for-sale housing. Read the City Council ordinance establishing the affordable housing fund Visit Denver's Affordable Housing Fund page for more information. Linkage Fee - Prior to July 1, 2022 The linkage fee went into effect in 2017 as one funding source of a dedicated affordable housing fund in Denver. The affordable housing fund is used to create and preserve thousands of affordable homes for low-to-moderate income families. The Expanding Housing Affordability ordinance became effective July 1, 2022 and increases linkage fees for certain development types. To find out if your project is exempt from the Expanding Housing Affordability ordinance linkage fee schedule, view the ordinance's effective dates . If your project is exempt from the Expanding Housing Affordability ordinance linkage fee schedule, you will still pay the linkage fee as determined by the previous fee schedule (that is subject to inflation-adjusted increases), or submit an exception. *Linkage fees are due prior to issuance of a building permit, except in cases of excavation and shoring. Fee schedule Fee Schedule Prior to July 1, 2022 Some development projects may be exempt from linkage fee amount increases under the Expanding Housing Affordability ordinance. These projects are still required to pay linkage fee amounts stipulated by the 2017 ordinance that are subject to inflation-adjusted increases. To find out if your project is exempt from the updated fee schedule, view the project effective dates . What projects does the fee apply to? Every project logging in for a building permit must document information required for compliance with Denver’s affordable housing fee. The affordable housing fee is assessed based on new gross floor area only (not including parking) and must be paid before receiving a building permit for the following: The fee does not apply to zoning or trade-specific permits (mechanical, electrical, etc.). If your project is in an existing building and is not adding any new square footage, or if you already know your project will qualify for one of the allowed exceptions from the fee, you must still submit the affordable housing fee application at log-in before receiving a fee waiver. Exceptions This table lists each exception allowed under the 2017 ordinance as well as what supporting materials are required to verify an individual exception. Any additional information listed in the table below must be received and verified by CPD prior to building permit issuance in order for the fee to be reduced or waived. Exceptions must be approved prior to SDP approval. As an alternative to the linkage fee, an applicant for a building permit has the option of including affordable housing units either on, or within a quarter-mile radius of, the subject property, according to a set formula. Application Forms & Administrative Rules and Regulations (only for projects subject to prior linkage fees) The forms below may only be used for projects subject to prior linkage fees.

Build On-Site – Baseline & Enhanced Requirements and Incentives Options for Building Affordable Homes On-Site As part of the Expanding Housing Affordability ordinance, new residential development of 10 or more units must build on-site affordable housing or meet the alternative compliance options (fee-in-lieu, negotiated alternatives). On-site building requirements and incentives are detailed in Section Sec. 27-224 of the Denver Revised Municipal Code (DRMC) and are summarized below. All incentives are by-right. Applicants may select from four build on-site requirements that vary by market area (PDF, 14MB) and tenure (rental/ownership). Projects complying with the baseline requirements receive three incentives and projects complying with the enhanced requirements receive additional incentives. Resources: Baseline Requirements and Incentives Incentives For projects providing the baseline level of affordable units to rent or to buy, the available incentives include: An Example of a Development Accessing Base Incentives A new 5-story multi-family rental development with 85 total units and 5,500 sf of street level retail is proposed on a parcel zoned G-MX-5 in a typical market. To be eligible for the base incentives, the applicant must comply with the base on-site compliance options. This applicant can either restrict 7 of the units as affordable to households earning up to 60% of Area Median Income (AMI) or 10 of the units as affordable to households earning an average of 70% AMI. If the applicant chooses to build 7 units at 60% AMI, the incentives would apply as follows: Linkage fee exemption of $15,950 = 5,500 GFA X $2.90 (note: linkage fees adjust annually) Enhanced Requirements and Incentives Projects that exceed Expanding Housing Affordability ordinance affordability requirements may be eligible for incentives beyond the baseline incentives offered in the ordinance. To qualify for enhanced incentives, a development project needs to meet or exceed the following build requirements: Incentives For projects providing the enhanced level of affordable units to rent or to buy, the available incentives include all of the base incentives PLUS: Maximum Height with Incentives in Stories and Feet An Example of a Development Accessing Enhanced Incentives A new 7-story rental multi-family residential development with 125 total units and 5,500sf of street level retail is proposed on a parcel zoned C-MX-5 in a typical market. The site is located within ¼ mile of a transit station and is neither adjacent to nor within 175-feet of a protected district. To qualify for the height incentives, the applicant must comply with the enhanced on-site compliance options. The applicant can either restrict 10 of the units as affordable to households earning up to 60% of Area Median Income (AMI), or restrict 15 of the units as affordable to households earning an average of 70% AMI. If the applicant chooses to build 15 units averaging 70% AMI, the incentives would apply as follows: Base Incentives: Enhanced Incentives: Frequently Asked Questions Do fully affordable housing projects (ex. Low Income Housing Tax Credit) qualify for the incentives? Yes, any project that meets or exceeds the Expanding Housing Affordability build-on-site requirements qualifies for the associated incentives. Fully affordable housing projects would qualify for enhanced incentives. How do protected districts impact height incentives? Protected district standards mitigate the impacts of development when it is adjacent to low-scale residential districts. These protected district standards include setbacks, stepbacks, and use limitations, in addition to maximum heights of 75-feet when within 175-feet of a protected district. If a site is within 175-feet of a protected district, the development may be limited to 75-feet and therefore not be able to access the full height incentive. See the specific zone district building form table for specific applicability . If I pay the fee-in-lieu, can I access any incentives? No, incentives are only available when building affordable units on-site. How do I calculate the minimum required number of income restricted units (IRUs)? Based on the compliance option selected and market area, an applicant should multiply the total number of units by the required percent of IRUs. For example, if a project is building 100 units, and they are building under compliance option T1-B (8% of units at 60% AMI or less), then 8 of their units must be income restricted to 60% AMI. Applicants can also use this calculator (XLSX, 37KB) to understand and compare compliance options. Rounding: In calculating the number of on-site IRUs, rounding is used such that five-tenths (0.5) or greater requires a whole unit. At least one unit must be provided if the calculation results in less than five-tenths (0.5). Ex. if a requirement is for 8.3 IRUs, the number of on-site IRUs would be eight. If a requirement is for 8.7 IRUs, the number of on-site IRUs would be nine. What are the minimum standards for the income restricted units? What is required for SDP approval? Prior to SDP approval, the applicant shall submit to HOST an executed Affordable Housing Plan (PDF, 704KB) to which the owner is committing to their appropriate compliance option and has been reviewed for alignment with the ordinance requirements and signed by HOST. How do local historic districts or landmark designations impact height incentives? Landmark Preservation reviews applications for new construction (infill) on all individual landmarks and properties within a historic district. Its design standards and guidelines ensure that any new construction is consistent with the character of the historic site or district. The Landmark Preservation Commission reviews each project individually and will determine the maximum height allowances based on the historic context. More information about the Landmark Preservation Design Review process for new infill sites is found here . Alternative Compliance Options In alignment with state law, the Expanding Housing Affordability ordinance provides alternative options to building on-site affordable housing. The alternative compliance options still contribute to affordable housing and are listed below. Fee-in-Lieu One alternative compliance option is a fee-in-lieu of building affordable units. To calculate the fee amount, developers choosing this option should first use the market area map below to determine if the project is in a typical market or a high cost market. Then, use the calculator to input the specifics of the project to calculate the fee-in-lieu amount. (More information can be found in Sec. 27-225 of the Denver Revised Municipal Code ). Market Area Map (PDF, 14MB) Compliance Option Calculator (XLSX, 37KB) Projects electing to pay the fee-in-lieu must pay the fee in full prior to issuance of a building permit, except in cases of excavation or shoring. $543,084.48 *The fee amounts will be adjusted annually for inflation. A 130-unit rental development in a typical market and under seven stories would be required to pay a total fee-in-lieu of $2,500,000: 8% unit requirement x 130 units = 10.4 units (10 units rounded to nearest tenth) 10 units x $250,000 per required affordable unit = $2,500,000 Negotiated Alternatives The negotiated alternative contributes to affordable housing needs through a negotiated agreement with the Department of Housing Stability (HOST) that better meets the goals of HOST’s Five-Year Strategic Plan , Blueprint Denver , Denver’s Comprehensive Plan , and the surrounding community. Examples of negotiated alternatives could include land dedication for new affordable housing development; fewer affordable units but restricted at a greater depth of affordability; developments providing larger layouts, more bedrooms, and family-friendly amenities; or concurrent off-site development of affordable housing. HOST is under no obligation to accept a negotiated alternative and must approve any such alternative. Terms of any negotiated alternative will bind the applicant and run with the land (the agreement will stay associated with the land regardless or ownership or development plan changes) upon approval by the director of HOST and recording with the clerk and recorded of the City and County of Denver. For more detail about Negotiated Alternatives, please see DRMC 27-226 . High-Impact Development The Expanding Housing Affordability ordinance stipulates that a ""high-impact development"" requires a tailored housing outcome informed by community outreach. Projects that qualify as High-Impact Developments must select this option in their application. High-impact development is defined as: High-Impact Developments, unless that designation is waived at the discretion of HOST, must finalize and record a high-impact development compliance plan approved by HOST. The compliance plan must demonstrate how the proposed development meets or exceeds the relevant standards set forth in the Expanding Housing Affordability ordinance for both the mandatory affordable housing requirement and the linkage fee requirement, as applicable. The compliance plan must also be informed by and responsive to a documented community engagement process. For more detail about High-Impact Developments, please see DRMC 27-229 . Exceptions to the Mandatory Affordable Housing Requirement Below are the list of exceptions to the mandatory affordable housing requirement of the Expanding Housing Affordability ordinance found in DRMC section 27-222, as well as required documentation that must be submitted to allow staff to review and confirm if the requested exception applies. Forms, Maps & Additional Resources Forms Resources Maps Which Linkage Fee Schedule Applies to my Project? Some development projects may be exempt from linkage fee amount increases under the Expanding Housing Affordability ordinance, which went into effect July 1, 2022. Projects exempt from the new fee schedule are still required to pay linkage fee amounts stipulated by the 2017 ordinance that are subject to inflation-adjusted increases.

Comprehensive Plan 2000 broadly guided Denver’s decisions about land use, mobility, parks, housing, economic growth, arts, culture and sustainability from 2000 to 2019. Denver has adopted a new comprehensive plan three times since 1977. Other key citywide plans like Blueprint Denver (2002 land use and transportation plan) and the Game Plan for parks and recreation (2003) were adopted by Denver City Council as supplements to the Comprehensive Plan 2000. When the Comprehensive Plan was updated in 2019, Blueprint Denver, Game Plan, and separate plans for transit and pedestrians and trails were also updated at the same time to create a holistic city vision. Comprehensive Plan 2040 Adoption The draft plan reviewed and adopted by City Council on April 22, 2019, reflects community comments received during two public review periods and input from Planning Board during a public hearing on March 30, 2019. The draft plan was reviewed by the Land Use, Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on April 2, 2019 and advanced to the full council on a unanimous vote.

January 2024: Financing Energy Projects with C-PACE Rebates and financial incentives help fund energy efficiency and clean energy building upgrades. But, these rebates and incentives often don't cover the entire cost of the upgrades. This is where the Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy Program (C-PACE) comes in. The program allows building owners to pay for these upgrades with no upfront cost. C-PACE places a voluntary assessment on the property owner's tax bill. Building owners can pay for the upgrade over an extended period (up to 25 years). They can transfer the repayment obligation to a future owner if they sell the building. Join us for a discussion and Q&A session with experts from C-PACE. You'll learn more about this innovative financing opportunity.

"Recycling Service Denver expanded solid waste services in 2023 with a new fee based on trash cart size. Weekly recycling and invoicing began in January and compost service will rollout starting in summer 2023. Rebates are available based on income and household size. Learn more about services, fees and rebates Use the Waste Directory below to determine where an item should be disposed of appropriately. _recollect_config = { area: ""Denver"" } On average, Denverites recycle only 63% of the recyclable waste generated by their household each year. Making small recycling changes can make a huge difference! Are businesses and apartments eligible for recycling services? Solid Waste Management, a department of the City & County of Denver Department of Transportation and Infrastructure, is only authorized to provide services to residential homes of seven or fewer units and our own municipal facilities.  Solid Waste Management cannot provide services to commercial properties such as businesses and apartment communities. How should I set out cardboard for recycling collection? Cardboard recycling steps: Remember: What are the benefits of recycling? Conserves Natural Resources: Lowers Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Reduce Need for Landfills Saves Energy Reduces Air & Groundwater Pollution Creates Jobs and Reduces Disposal Costs: If a plastic item has a recycling symbol on it, is it recyclable? Not necessarily! The recycling symbol represents the general category of plastic that material is made from, but does not mean the item is recyclable here in Denver. Generally, we can accept plastic containers like bottles, tubs, jugs, and jars . If it's not a container, it likely cannot go in the recycling. Plastics vary greatly by their resin types and how they are manufactured.  There are also two common manufacturing processes: plastic bottles are “blow molded,” whereas, most plastic tubs are “injection molded.”  As a result of the different resin types, the different manufacturing processes, and the different mixes of chemical additives, (dyes, plasticizers, UV inhibitors, softeners, adhesives and more) plastics melt at different temperatures, have different physical properties, and as such need to be recycled differently. Once plastics are separated into their varying categories they must then be shipped to a recycler.  The distance to these plastic markets can be large and the cost to ship certain types of plastic to distant processing facilities may simply be more expensive than the material’s value.  Some markets are very limited and are overstocked with plastics for recycling. All of these parts of the recycling process can affect a city's ability to accept certain plastics. How clean should my items be for recycling? Denver Recycles asks residents to make sure that bottles, jars, pie tins, and other containers are empty before putting them in with your recycling. Containers do not need to be completely free of all food residue. Generally, a quick rinse is sufficient. Thicker food residue in containers, like peanut butter jars, might need a little more rinsing or even a wiping out of the food residue. As long as containers are empty and free of most food residue they are acceptable for recycling.

"2023 Sanitary Sewer Master Plan Overview The City and County of Denver Sanitary Sewer Master Plan (SSMP)
is a living document that evaluates Denver’s sanitary sewer capacity and level of service. It provides guidance on capacity improvement needs to maintain an appropriate level of service to residents and businesses and support the growth in the City. North Denver Sanitary Sewer, Circa 1910-1920 Photo courtesy of Denver Public Library, Western History Collection Sewer crew laying clay line in trench, 1923 Photo courtesy of Denver Public Library, Western History Collection Sewer pipe sections and wooden forms, Circa 1909 Photo courtesy of Denver Public Library, Western History Collection Background The City’s sanitary sewer system covers approximately 155 square miles of land area and provides services to over 730,000 people. As shown in Figure 1, the sanitary sewer system is an underground system that collects sanitary flows from residences and businesses, where it is then transported to the Metro Water Recovery’s Robert W. Hite Treatment Facility for treatment.  The City-owned and operated sanitary sewer system consists of 7 lift stations, 10 miles of sanitary sewer force mains, and over 1,500 miles of gravity sewer pipe network ranging in size from 6 to 60-inches. The City has provided sanitary sewer service for over 150 years and has conducted multiple Sanitary Sewer Master Plans (SSMPs) over the last 70 years, starting in 1950 with the most recent SSMP completed in 2023. The 2023 update is built upon the prior master plans and the current design criteria, while leveraging the advancement in hydraulic modeling to evaluate the system in a comprehensive way. It provides guidance to capacity improvements to maintain an appropriate level of service to existing and future residents and businesses in the City’s sanitary sewer system area. Authorization The City commissioned this master plan as an update to the 2009 SSMP to provide a digital master plan that utilizes the most up-to-date flow monitoring and hydraulic modeling practices. It provides a clear understanding of the existing level of service as well as a high-level, conceptual snapshot of the 2050 planning horizon that align with the land use and growth projections as anticipated in the City’s Blueprint Denver (Denveright) and Denver Moves Everyone plans. Intent This SSMP document is a high-level citywide planning tool that aims to analyze and evaluate Denver’s existing sanitary sewer flows, provides guidance on the capacity improvements to maintain appropriate level of service to residents and businesses, and support the growth in the City. While the SSMP did not provide prioritization of the recommended improvements, it did provide the technical data required to develop projects to support the City’s data-driven decision making. Project prioritization occurs by the City during the City’s 6-Year Capital Improvement Program (CIP), which incorporate a wide variety of factors such as equity and regulatory compliance in addition to all technical data developed from the SSMP. The CIP not only considers the SSMP recommendations, but also takes other identified infrastructure needs into consideration within the City to leverage available funding in order to achieve multiple benefits when it is possible. Figure 1. Sanitary versus Stormwater Process The 2023 SSMP update process began with research and data collection, identifying data quality issues for successful hydraulic model construction. Next steps included hydraulic model development, hydraulic model calibration and validation, flow projection, system performance evaluation, and the production of prioritization toolsets to guide future improvements. This resulted in a fully digital master plan that is adaptive and can be used for years to come. Approach The approach for this SSMP update includes the following key tasks: Data Collection: Collection of as-builts and GIS data to support the construction of a fully dynamic hydraulic model. A flow monitoring project was conducted as part of the SSMP to monitor the flowrates in the City’s sanitary sewer system across the entire service area, capturing dry weather and wet weather flows to serve as the basis to guide hydraulic model calibration. Hydraulic Model: A comprehensive hydraulic model was constructed to dynamically model the City’s sanitary sewer system and serve as the tool to evaluate the system performance and identify improvement needs to meet the current and future needs. The model was calibrated to the current observed flowrates to ensure the simulated flow rates is well represented across the City’s entire sewer system. System Evaluations: The master plan evaluated the existing Level of Service (LOS) provided to residents and business across the City based on hydraulic modeling results. The master plan also evaluated how the future growth in the City (based on regional and Denver specific planning datasets) may impact the sanitary sewer infrastructure, and identified potential improvements that may be required to support the growth. Master Plan: A comprehensive documentation of all tasks completed as part of the master planning effort, as well as digital deliverables including hydraulic models, GIS database, and numerous toolsets developed to support CIP planning.

"2023 Sanitary Sewer Master Plan Overview The City and County of Denver Sanitary Sewer Master Plan (SSMP)
is a living document that evaluates Denver’s sanitary sewer capacity and level of service. It provides guidance on capacity improvement needs to maintain an appropriate level of service to residents and businesses and support the growth in the City. North Denver Sanitary Sewer, Circa 1910-1920 Photo courtesy of Denver Public Library, Western History Collection Sewer crew laying clay line in trench, 1923 Photo courtesy of Denver Public Library, Western History Collection Sewer pipe sections and wooden forms, Circa 1909 Photo courtesy of Denver Public Library, Western History Collection Background The City’s sanitary sewer system covers approximately 155 square miles of land area and provides services to over 730,000 people. As shown in Figure 1, the sanitary sewer system is an underground system that collects sanitary flows from residences and businesses, where it is then transported to the Metro Water Recovery’s Robert W. Hite Treatment Facility for treatment.  The City-owned and operated sanitary sewer system consists of 7 lift stations, 10 miles of sanitary sewer force mains, and over 1,500 miles of gravity sewer pipe network ranging in size from 6 to 60-inches. The City has provided sanitary sewer service for over 150 years and has conducted multiple Sanitary Sewer Master Plans (SSMPs) over the last 70 years, starting in 1950 with the most recent SSMP completed in 2023. The 2023 update is built upon the prior master plans and the current design criteria, while leveraging the advancement in hydraulic modeling to evaluate the system in a comprehensive way. It provides guidance to capacity improvements to maintain an appropriate level of service to existing and future residents and businesses in the City’s sanitary sewer system area. Authorization The City commissioned this master plan as an update to the 2009 SSMP to provide a digital master plan that utilizes the most up-to-date flow monitoring and hydraulic modeling practices. It provides a clear understanding of the existing level of service as well as a high-level, conceptual snapshot of the 2050 planning horizon that align with the land use and growth projections as anticipated in the City’s Blueprint Denver (Denveright) and Denver Moves Everyone plans. Intent This SSMP document is a high-level citywide planning tool that aims to analyze and evaluate Denver’s existing sanitary sewer flows, provides guidance on the capacity improvements to maintain appropriate level of service to residents and businesses, and support the growth in the City. While the SSMP did not provide prioritization of the recommended improvements, it did provide the technical data required to develop projects to support the City’s data-driven decision making. Project prioritization occurs by the City during the City’s 6-Year Capital Improvement Program (CIP), which incorporate a wide variety of factors such as equity and regulatory compliance in addition to all technical data developed from the SSMP. The CIP not only considers the SSMP recommendations, but also takes other identified infrastructure needs into consideration within the City to leverage available funding in order to achieve multiple benefits when it is possible. Figure 1. Sanitary versus Stormwater Process The 2023 SSMP update process began with research and data collection, identifying data quality issues for successful hydraulic model construction. Next steps included hydraulic model development, hydraulic model calibration and validation, flow projection, system performance evaluation, and the production of prioritization toolsets to guide future improvements. This resulted in a fully digital master plan that is adaptive and can be used for years to come.

"Small Gas Uses Gas Stoves, Fireplaces, Outdoor Heaters Gas stove tops, fireplaces, and other small gas appliances are only responsible for 3% of gas usage and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions.  As Denver works to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from buildings and homes City and County of Denver staff are most focused on reducing the 97% of building and home natural gas emissions that come from space and water heat through a transition to renewable heating and cooling. There are community health implications associated with some of these appliances as well as less harmful alternatives. How can you cut 97% of your gas use? Plan to electrify your space and water heating! The vast majority of natural gas in your home is used to heat your home when it's cold, as well as heating your water. You can electrify these appliances and eliminate the biggest uses of natural gas in your home. Heat pumps and heat pump water heaters are effective, safe, efficient and quiet. They can be two or three-times more efficient than even the best natural gas furnaces and water heat pumps. Ways to Reduce the 3% of Your Gas Use from Small Gas Appliances Induction cooking units are much more efficient and safer than both electric and gas counterparts. Of the top cooktops identified by Consumer Reports in 2020, six were electric. The top two were induction cooktops. Induction cooking works by heating the pot or pan through electromagnetic waves, rather than the stovetop itself. This means: Induction cooktops can also be used in commercial or restaurant environments. They are and are more effective for: Gas cook stoves also have additional health and climate risks. A study by RMI found children in a home with a gas stove have a 24–42% increased risk of having asthma. Because we spend up to 90% of our lives inside buildings ( U.S. EPA ), indoor air quality is paramount to the health of Denver residents and their loved ones. Leaks from Gas Appliances A Stanford study found that natural gas stoves leak up to 1.3 percent of the gas they use as unburned methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Gas stoves can release carbon monoxide, formaldehyde and other harmful pollutants, which can be harmful to people and pets. Exposure can cause or worsen health problems such as nose and throat irritation, headaches, fatigue and nausea. Young children and people with asthma or heart or lung disease are especially vulnerable to indoor air pollution. Many consumers are familiar with electric resistance fireplaces, but a better electric alternatives exist. Fireplace manufacturers continue to rise the challenge of creating a look as close to a natural wood fire as possible. One example is “water vapor fireplaces” which provide both the look and feel of a real fire with swirling fire-like water vapor and LED lights. This technology utilizes a 120V outlet and can warm spaces up to 800 square feet – sufficient for both commercial and residential uses. Most importantly, unlike their gas counterparts, the electric options do not emit carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide. The electric counterparts to propone patio heaters, like those used for outdoor dining, plug into either 120V or 240V outlets and use infrared technology that does not waste energy heating the space around the people, but instead heats up surfaces– such as people or their clothing – directly. Most importantly, this warming effect is not impacted by a breeze or wind as the infrared technology only heats solid objects. If you represent a restaurant that uses electric induction cooking equipment or are a user of any of the above electric alternatives to gas appliances, please contact us at electrification@denvergov.org if you’re willing to share your experience.

You are the ones who help building and condo owners understand their HVAC equipment. You help them select, buy, and install that equipment. The resources here will help you navigate this process. Learn how to: For information about permitting please refer to Community Planning and Development E-permits . Still have questions?  Please contact the program administrator: Heat Pump Bonuses for Contractors and Distributors Denver is now providing bonuses to distributors and contractors for stocking, selling, and installing heat pumps. The goal is to make heat pumps easier for consumers to purchase and increase demand for this equipment. Permitting a Heat Pump Many of Denver's contractors are unfamiliar with exactly how to properly pull a permit for a heat pump. That's okay! We're here to help. Electrification Feasibility Reports (EFRs) Denver's building code now requires additional paperwork to permit a like-for-like gas equipment replacement. The Electrification Feasibility Report (EFR) is one option for additional paperwork you can submit with your permit. Equipment Rebates Building owners can now receive thousands of dollars in rebates when they install a heat pump. Find out what you can do to grow your business and help your clients get these rebates. Program Processes Learn how to navigate each of our rebate programs so you know what to expect when you use them! Overview HVAC Contractors, Electricians, Plumbers and Mechanical Engineers play an important role helping building owners and individual condo owners select, purchase and install the best HVAC options for a building. The resources here will help you navigate permitting a heat pump, using the Electrification Feasibility Report , and building electrification. For permitting specific information please refer to Community Planning and Development E-permits . Permitting a Heat Pump The permitting process for installing heat pumps has not changed, but it might be new for contractors used to applying for a Quick Permit. When a gas-fired warm-air furnace, Unitary AC, or gas-fired hot water heater is replaced with a heat pump or partial (dual fuel) heat pump equipment, it cannot be permitted as a Quick Permit. You will have to apply using the Building Log application in E-permits .  Some things to consider: See E-Permit FAQs and Video Tutorials Using E-Permits After logging in with your Username or E-mail and password, click on ""Apply for a Permit"" Be sure to select the Building Log application and follow the instructions from there.

For questions about what documentation is required for permits now that quick permits are only allowed for emergency replacement, contact Community Planning and Development. Frequently Asked Questions Permitting Yes. Quick permits are still allowed for emergency replacements. Emergency replacement is not based on timeline. An emergency replacement is allowed if only one piece of heating, cooling, or service water heating equipment, or ventilation system is failing and will be replaced with the same heating or cooling capacity and no other alterations are made. If multiple pieces of equipment need to be replaced, it will not be considered an emergency replacement. Section C501.5 of the Denver Energy Code provides provisions for application of the energy code to historic buildings. The permitting process is the same, however, the Landmark Team with Community Planning and Development would review any exterior work. We expect most of the equipment affected by the March 1, 2023 code change will qualify as a Minor Commercial Project. Average plan review times are available on Community Planning and Development’s dashboard . The Electrification Feasibility Report is one of several options for compliance with new permitting requirements for gas space and water heating equipment in commercial and multifamily buildings. An Electrification Feasibility Report is NOT required to pull a permit for heat pump equipment. Electrification Feasibility Report The Electrification Feasibility Report is a tool to help a building owner determine if they should get a bid for a heat pump. The tool considers items such as: Not now. Starting in 2025 , electrification will be required for gas furnaces, unitary AC/condensing units serving a heated space, and gas water heaters when the Electrification Feasibility Report indicates that it is cost effective. In 2027 PTACs, VTACs, and boilers be required to be electrified when cost effective. Michaels Energy will review all Electrification Feasibility Reports and will contact you with questions or to provide results within one week of the date of submittal. In the Electrification Feasibility Report tool, you will only be able to see reports that you have created. Your competition won’t be able to view your reports. If you are bidding against another contractor, only ONE contractor can receive a rebate to complete an Electrification Feasibility Report for each specific piece of equipment in a building. To receive a rebate, preapproval from Michaels Energy is required. Building owners can contact Michaels Energy if they’re getting a second bid and want to compare the results of the Electrification Feasibility Reports from the two bids. If the owner is likely to replace all the systems, divide the design cost across the systems and complete separate Electrification Feasibility Reports for each system. You can do this by duplicating the tab in the electrification feasibility report tool. Please contact Michaels Energy at DenverElectrification@MichaelsEnergy.com or 720.782.7661 if you need help doing this. If the owner only wants to replace one piece of equipment, then only complete one Electrification Feasibility Report and allocate all the design costs there. The net present value of a new gas system is compared to the net present value of a new electric (heat pump or partially electrified) system. If the net present value of the gas system is less than or equal to 15% greater than the electric system, the electric system is deemed cost effective. Net present value is a financial tool used to determine the value of an investment over its lifetime in terms of today’s value of money. The net present value includes the capital cost to install the new equipment (equipment + labor + other expenses), the cost to operate the piece of equipment (the cost of the energy consumed by the equipment) over the equipment’s expected lifetime and the social cost of carbon over the equipment’s expected lifetime. The social cost of carbon is estimated using the methodology found in the building code: Rebates For building owners to be eligible for Building Electrification Program rebates, they must use a contractor who has attended an Electrification Feasibility Report training or watched the recording online, and passed the quiz administered at the end of the training. See the list of eligible contractors To receive a rebate, preapproval from Michaels Energy is required. Visit our Building Electrification Rebates page to learn more and apply. No. Only one contractor will be paid for an Electrification Feasibility Report for any single piece of equipment. An Electrification Feasibility Report is for one piece of equipment. If two contractors do Electrification Feasibility Reports for two different pieces of equipment, both contractors could receive rebates for their respective report. To be eligible for the Electrification Feasibility Report rebate, the building owner must submit a rebate application and be pre-approved prior to a contractor completing an Electrification Feasibility Report. This prevents the creation of two reports for the same piece of equipment. Electrification Yes! According to Xcel Energy spokesperson Michelle Aguayo, ""We are planning the grid to meet the anticipated demands of beneficial electrification of buildings, transportation and others reliably and affordably. Our Power Pathway transmission project and Electric Resource Plan, both of which were approved by the Commission last year, provide an important foundation for generating and delivering more clean energy that will support the city of Denver’s electrification and sustainability goals."" The City and County of Denver and Xcel Energy meet monthly to discuss any upgrades to the grid that might be needed via their Energy Future Collaboration . Additionally, we are conducting a study, in collaboration with Xcel Energy, of Xcel Energy’s Denver distribution system to identify any areas of capacity needs for building electrification, EV charging, or renewable energy integration. Gas backup, or dual fuel equipment, is allowed and may be the best, most cost-effective option for many buildings. Partial electrification (leaving some of the existing equipment in place) is also an option. There are very effective cold climate heat pumps that can operate effectively at temperatures below zero. Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnerships (NEEP) has a list of residential-style cold climate air-source heat pumps . Multifamily buildings affected by Energize Denver’s electrification requirements in the 2022 Denver Building and Fire Code include all existing commercial and multifamily buildings regulated by the Denver Energy Code’s Commercial Provisions . This includes commercial buildings, multifamily apartment buildings, and multifamily condominium buildings. Single family dwellings, two-family dwellings, and townhomes are not subject to Energize Denver’s electrification requirements.
