Zuni St. The St. Charles Recreation Center, 3777 Lafayette St., will provide overnight shelter from 8 p.m. to 7 a.m. beginning the evening of Jan. 7 through the morning of Monday, Jan 13. St. Charles will open after 9 p.m. Friday, Jan. 10 due to previously scheduled programming. Individuals in need of shelter are encouraged to go to “front door” shelter access points: • For individual men – Denver Rescue Mission Lawrence Street Community Center, 2222 Lawrence St. • For individual women – Samaritan House, 2301 Lawrence St. • For youth ages 15-20 – Urban Peak, 1630 S. Acoma St. • Families in need of shelter should call the Connection Center at 303-295-3366. A printable flier of this information is available here. (PDF, 119KB) The Department of Housing Stability (HOST) partners with many agencies citywide to provide shelter for people experiencing homelessness. There are many shelter facilities throughout the city, so rather than requiring people in crisis to navigate a complex system, we have identified specific centrally-located facilities as the “front door” access to the entire system. These locations have longer hou rs for intake and have transportation available to other facilities. They can also help people navigate which shelter facility is the best option for their individual situation. HOST is now offering a free circulator bus service for persons experiencing homelessness from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Monday through Friday.

Walk-up Shelter Access & “Front Door” Referral Centers If you or someone you know is in housing crisis and needs shelter urgently, please refer them to “front door” facilities, where we offer both walk-up access and have the ability to refer (and sometimes transport) to other shelters as appropriate. Walk-up only centers do not refer to other facilities. Find this information in printable form here.

See the Save Haven site for more information. Other Shelter Facilities These providers are also part of Denver’s shelter network, but do not transport to other facilities, and are therefore not recommended “front door” entry points. Locations listed here without an address are NOT walk-up facilities. Delores Project: women and transgender individuals, (303) 534-5411, beds are assigned only by phone at 10 a.m. daily Day Centers and Supportive Services These facilities are available for people to access during daytime business hours listed, but are NOT overnight shelters.

The alternatives include options for couples, people with pets, transgender individuals, people with health conditions, people who are recovering from COVID, families, people living in a vehicle, and other extenuating circumstances. These programs are limited and have waiting lists, and are NOT walk-up accessible. To access these programs, please work with an outreach worker or case manager at one of the “front door” shelters or a day center for a referral.

Lunch served 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Access Points Throughout Metro Denver Access Points are locations where those experiencing homelessness can access Metro Denver’s Coordinated Entry System (CES). The purpose of Coordinated Entry is to ensure that people experiencing homelessness have equitable access to the housing resources they need to resolve their housing crisis. You can find all the Metro Denver Access Points here. Severe Weather Shelter Plans Severe weather poses a serious danger to those staying outside, and we encourage people to come inside. HOST, alongside shelter and outreach partners, monitors weather and shelter usage to activate severe weather protocols and shelter expansions as necessary. The City’s Emergency Operations Plan calls for the opening of recreation centers as warming locations during regular business hours, and additional overnight shelter to ensure capacity for everyone to come inside when temperatures are unsafe. The Denver Department of Public Health & Environment (DDPHE) is the lead agency in monitoring weather conditions and determining when temperatures indicate a need for severe weather activation. So that people in crisis do not have to figure out where shelter is available, people in need of shelter should be referred to the city’s “front door” shelter access points and will be transported to overnight shelter. If additional overflow shelter is activated, a banner will appear on the denvergov.org website and additional information will be posted at the top of this page. 2024-2025 Severe Weather Shelter Plan (PDF, 309KB) Related Links You May Also Find Helpful Contact 3-1-1 Report an Issue Call 3-1-1 Outside Denver: (720) 913-1311 Hearing Impaired Only (TTY): (720) 913-8479 For Emergencies: 9-1-1 Visit Other Denver Sites Share & Connect The Denver Local is your resource for city news and information directly to your inbox.

https://www.denvergov.org/Open-Records-CORA,Colorado Open Records Act,"['community', 'environment', 'safety']",2025-01-07T18:29:04.217984,www.denvergov.org,10651,"Colorado Open Records Act The City and County of Denver is committed to making city government open, accountable and accessible to the public. The City’s approach to the Colorado Open Records Act (CORA) is an important part of its pledge to transparency to build trust with our residents. These guidelines help City agencies and departments provide the public with efficient access to documents and records pursuant to the Colorado Revised Statutes, C.R.S. §24-72-205(6). Making a Records Request Requesters must submit a request to the agency that is the custodian of the record itself. The City does not maintain a central repository for public records or a single office that fulfills requests. Please visit the City Directory online for a list of department webpages for each City agency to request and obtain records. You will find information on how to make a CORA request on the agencies' Contact page. For further information, contact the agency directly to ask how to submit a CORA request. PLEASE NOTE: A CORA request received after 3 p.m. or any day that the agency is officially closed will be considered received on the following working day. CORA Costs To pay for the cost of processing a CORA request, the agency may charge for the time spent to research and respond to requests for records under CORA. Time and Cost Estimates Agencies may provide the requester with a time and cost estimate, which may require a pre-payment before processing the request. If you pay for more time than is spent processing your request, you will receive a refund. Document Format Documents may be available in their native format if they do not need to be redacted or if they can be readily accessed. Documents such as databases or spreadsheets that can be sorted or searched will be available in a similar format. The City will not provide documents in a format that requires providing software or that would violate the terms of any agreement or rights held by a third party, such as licensing agreements or copyrights.

To accomplish this task, Denver has roughly two dozen ""zoning and neighborhood inspectors"" (Z/NIS), who handle public education and code enforcement throughout the city's 155 square miles. Items intended for outdoor use on a residential property such as picnic tables, children's toys and bicycles are allowed to be kept outdoors. Items intended for indoor use such as upholstered furniture and household appliances may not be stored outside. Tools, equipment and supplies utilized for automobile repair or construction may not be stored outside. Parking on dirt areas is not allowed. Allowable parking surfaces for single-family dwellings include 6 inches of gravel, road base material (recycled asphalt), asphalt, or concrete. Allowable parking surfaces for 2-unit dwellings or multi-unit dwellings include road base, asphalt, or concrete. Denver households are allowed one vehicle per licensed driver, plus one extra vehicle. For example, a household consisting of three licensed drivers may have up to four vehicles at the residence. Additional cars would be considered in violation of the code. Plant growth may not extend onto adjacent sidewalks, streets or alleys, or block visibility at street corners. Fences must be maintained, built to proper height (generally 4’ in the front and 6’ in the sides and back of residential lots), and constructed with approved materials (no barbed wire, corrugated metal or salvage materials). Check to see whether your fence requires a permit . Denver’s city ordinance requires that property owners keep sidewalks clear at all times. After snow has stopped falling, inspectors begin enforcement — checking for snowy/icy sidewalks in business areas the same day and residential areas the following day. Parking or storing inoperable motor vehicles in any residential zone district is restricted to one vehicle that must be stored inside an enclosed garage. A vehicle that is not operable cannot be stored on the street or in a driveway of a home. Residents may have one yard sale every six months in Denver, provided that the sale lasts for less than 72 hours, items offered for sale were not bought for resale or received on consignment for the purpose of resale, and all external evidence of the sale is removed immediately afterward. Home occupations are allowed in Denver. The business must be operated by the resident in a completely enclosed structure, the primary dwelling unit or a detached accessory structure as allowed by the zoning code. The home occupation shall not display or create outside the building any external evidence of its operation. A sign of up to 100 square inches in size is allowed. See the Project Guide for Home Businesses for information . The Denver Zoning Code regulates how many household pets can be part of a home residence. Violations occur when the number of household pets exceeds 2 rabbits, 25 pigeons, 2 domestic honey bee hives, or more than 5 dogs and cats combined (you cannot have more than 3 dogs as part of the combined total). Most construction projects require a zoning permit and may also require a building permit. For example, construction of fences, sheds, and gazebos all require zoning permits and depending on their design require a building permit too. Check the requirements for your project under Single-Family and Duplex Projects . More Information Have questions?

The City’s approach to the Colorado Open Records Act (CORA) is an important part of its pledge to transparency to build trust with our residents. These guidelines help City agencies and departments provide the public with efficient access to documents and records pursuant to the Colorado Revised Statutes, C.R.S. §24-72-205(6). Making a Records Request Requesters must submit a request to the agency that is the custodian of the record itself. The City does not maintain a central repository for public records or a single office that fulfills requests. PLEASE NOTE: A CORA request received after 3 p.m. or any day that the agency is officially closed will be considered received on the following working day. CORA Costs To pay for the cost of processing a CORA request, the agency may charge for the time spent to research and respond to requests for records under CORA. Time and Cost Estimates Agencies may provide the requester with a time and cost estimate, which may require a pre-payment before processing the request. If you pay for more time than is spent processing your request, you will receive a refund. Document Format Documents may be available in their native format if they do not need to be redacted or if they can be readily accessed. Documents such as databases or spreadsheets that can be sorted or searched will be available in a similar format. The City will not provide documents in a format that requires providing software or that would violate the terms of any agreement or rights held by a third party, such as licensing agreements or copyrights.

Note: this graphic is intended to be a high-level visual aid. For more detailed information on requirements, visit the corresponding webpages: Why does Denver have the goal for all new buildings and homes to achieve Zero Emissions by 2030? Greenhouse gas emissions trap heat and contribute to climate change. Buildings and Homes are responsible for 64% of Denver’s the air-polluting greenhouse gas emissions. However, a building or home that is Zero Emissions does not contribute to greenhouse gas emissions once the local grid is decarbonized. Zero Emissions new buildings are: Xcel Energy provides all the electricity that Denver purchases. Xcel Energy is on track to reduce carbon emissions from their electrical grid by 85% by 2030 by producing electricity with renewables, such as solar and wind. Since Zero Emissions new buildings and homes are all-electric, these buildings only use only electricity to heat, cool, and operate. They do not rely on the use of fossil fuels. These all-electric buildings can take advantage of the work Xcel Energy is doing to create a cleaner renewable grid. This is not the case if the building still uses natural gas or other fossil fuels. The chart below shows Xcel Energy’s grid moving towards lower carbon emissions by 2030. This is known as ""decarbonizing the grid."" The closer the line gets to 100% carbon emission reduction, the less greenhouse gas emissions Colorado’s grid produces. Through Senate Bill 19-236, the Colorado Legislature has required electric utilities to decarbonize the electric grid by 80% by 2030.  Xcel Energy has voluntarily exceeded that target and filed a plan that achieves at least an 85% emissions reduction by 2030. There are also many additional benefits to Zero Emissions homes and buildings, such as: How Do We Make Buildings All-Electric? Heat pumps are a part of the solution. More efficient all-electric heating and cooling equipment, like heat pumps, are available. Heat pumps: Cold climate heat pumps are readily available. Cold climate heat pumps can maintain a higher efficiency and capacity at lower temperatures and work great in Colorado’s climate. They can maintain more than 70% of their capacity at temperatures as low as 5°F.  And many can operate effectively even when it is -10 degrees Fahrenheit outside.

While we strive to provide accurate estimates based on current 90-day averages, actual review times may vary by project. Community Planning and Development is committed to monitoring and sharing review times and making adjustments as needed to provide excellent quality of work and customer service for all projects. Some projects will have a due date listed in e-permits. These dates are set automatically based on target review times, and do not adjust in response to volume or capacity. For a more accurate estimate, please use the dates provided in the dashboard below based on when your permit application was accepted for review. Projects are reviewed in the order they are received by the next available staff member. E-permits will not list a specific reviewer for your project until one is available and the project has been officially picked up for review by that individual. Q2 Update: Mayor's Goal to Reduce Permitting Time On July 15, 2024, Mayor Mike Johnston, joined by Denver Community Planning and Development and other city agencies, announced that the city has cut bureaucratic red tape and streamlined processes to exceed Mayor Johnston’s goal of cutting residential permitting times by 30 percent and is on track to reduce commercial permitting times by 30 percent by the end of the year. Previous efforts combined with current innovations and initiatives are helping the city make progress in meeting the mayor’s goal by the end of 2024. This progress reflects steps the city took several months ago to reduce the backlog in permit review times. Community Planning and Development has also met with several city stakeholders, including the Downtown Denver Partnership and developers, to collect feedback and act on solutions. Staff have been focused on driving the improvements and will continue to do so. The city also recognizes that these timelines can still fluctuate if other variables are at play. Changes in permit application volumes, staffing levels, and market activity have the potential to affect plan review timelines positively or negatively before the end of 2024. Throughout the year, the city will continue to monitor progress and prioritize solutions that will help us achieve the permitting timeline goals.

is a living document that evaluates Denver’s sanitary sewer capacity and level of service. It provides guidance on capacity improvement needs to maintain an appropriate level of service to residents and businesses and support the growth in the City. North Denver Sanitary Sewer, Circa 1910-1920 Photo courtesy of Denver Public Library, Western History Collection Sewer crew laying clay line in trench, 1923 Photo courtesy of Denver Public Library, Western History Collection Sewer pipe sections and wooden forms, Circa 1909 Photo courtesy of Denver Public Library, Western History Collection Background The City’s sanitary sewer system covers approximately 155 square miles of land area and provides services to over 730,000 people. As shown in Figure 1, the sanitary sewer system is an underground system that collects sanitary flows from residences and businesses, where it is then transported to the Metro Water Recovery’s Robert W. Hite Treatment Facility for treatment.  The City-owned and operated sanitary sewer system consists of 7 lift stations, 10 miles of sanitary sewer force mains, and over 1,500 miles of gravity sewer pipe network ranging in size from 6 to 60-inches. The City has provided sanitary sewer service for over 150 years and has conducted multiple Sanitary Sewer Master Plans (SSMPs) over the last 70 years, starting in 1950 with the most recent SSMP completed in 2023. The 2023 update is built upon the prior master plans and the current design criteria, while leveraging the advancement in hydraulic modeling to evaluate the system in a comprehensive way. It provides guidance to capacity improvements to maintain an appropriate level of service to existing and future residents and businesses in the City’s sanitary sewer system area. Authorization The City commissioned this master plan as an update to the 2009 SSMP to provide a digital master plan that utilizes the most up-to-date flow monitoring and hydraulic modeling practices. It provides a clear understanding of the existing level of service as well as a high-level, conceptual snapshot of the 2050 planning horizon that align with the land use and growth projections as anticipated in the City’s Blueprint Denver (Denveright) and Denver Moves Everyone plans. Intent This SSMP document is a high-level citywide planning tool that aims to analyze and evaluate Denver’s existing sanitary sewer flows, provides guidance on the capacity improvements to maintain appropriate level of service to residents and businesses, and support the growth in the City. While the SSMP did not provide prioritization of the recommended improvements, it did provide the technical data required to develop projects to support the City’s data-driven decision making. Project prioritization occurs by the City during the City’s 6-Year Capital Improvement Program (CIP), which incorporate a wide variety of factors such as equity and regulatory compliance in addition to all technical data developed from the SSMP. The CIP not only considers the SSMP recommendations, but also takes other identified infrastructure needs into consideration within the City to leverage available funding in order to achieve multiple benefits when it is possible. Figure 1. Sanitary versus Stormwater Process The 2023 SSMP update process began with research and data collection, identifying data quality issues for successful hydraulic model construction. Next steps included hydraulic model development, hydraulic model calibration and validation, flow projection, system performance evaluation, and the production of prioritization toolsets to guide future improvements. This resulted in a fully digital master plan that is adaptive and can be used for years to come. Approach The approach for this SSMP update includes the following key tasks: Data Collection: Collection of as-builts and GIS data to support the construction of a fully dynamic hydraulic model. A flow monitoring project was conducted as part of the SSMP to monitor the flowrates in the City’s sanitary sewer system across the entire service area, capturing dry weather and wet weather flows to serve as the basis to guide hydraulic model calibration. Hydraulic Model: A comprehensive hydraulic model was constructed to dynamically model the City’s sanitary sewer system and serve as the tool to evaluate the system performance and identify improvement needs to meet the current and future needs. The model was calibrated to the current observed flowrates to ensure the simulated flow rates is well represented across the City’s entire sewer system. System Evaluations: The master plan evaluated the existing Level of Service (LOS) provided to residents and business across the City based on hydraulic modeling results. The master plan also evaluated how the future growth in the City (based on regional and Denver specific planning datasets) may impact the sanitary sewer infrastructure, and identified potential improvements that may be required to support the growth. Master Plan: A comprehensive documentation of all tasks completed as part of the master planning effort, as well as digital deliverables including hydraulic models, GIS database, and numerous toolsets developed to support CIP planning.

When the Expanding Housing Affordability (EHA) ordinance became effective on July 1, 2022, it updated the affordable housing linkage fee (established in 2017 for many development types) and created new affordable housing requirements for developments of 10 or more new dwelling units. As of July 1, 2022, all application projects will be prompted in e-permits to demonstrate how they meet the requirements of Denver’s Expanding Housing Affordability ordinance. About the EHA Ordinance The Expanding Housing Affordability ordinance will create more affordable housing options for our workforce as well as increase funding for Denver’s Affordable Housing Fund. There are three core elements: Read about the history of the Expanding Housing Affordability ordinance >> Complying with the EHA Ordinance Residential developments of 10 units or more may fulfill the ordinance requirements by: All other development types are required to pay the updated linkage fee. Please note that mixed-use developments that include 10 or more residential units must meet the mandatory affordable housing requirement for the residential portion and pay the linkage fee for the non-residential portion. Linkage Fee - Starting July 1, 2022 The linkage fee went into effect in 2017 as one funding source of a dedicated affordable housing fund in Denver. The affordable housing fund is used to create and preserve thousands of affordable homes for low-to-moderate income families. The Expanding Housing Affordability ordinance became effective July 1, 2022 and increases linkage fees for non-residential development and residential development of 9 or fewer units. For mixed-use buildings containing 10 or more dwelling units, the non-residential portion of the building must pay the linkage fee unless it is a ground-floor commercial, sale, or service use that is eligible for an exception per the incentives or is eligible for another exception. To find out if your project is exempt from the Expanding Housing Affordability ordinance's updated linkage fee schedule, view the ordinance's effective dates . If your project is exempt, proceed to this page . Linkage fees are due prior to issuance of a building permit, except in cases of excavation and shoring. Fee schedule Updated July 2022 Current Fee Schedule Fee changes are published here and in the building permit fee policy (PDF, 162KB) . Height and Floor Area Incentives for Enhanced Linkage Fees To encourage commercial employment grown in downtown and urban areas near transit while providing additional funding for affordable housing, the Denver Zoning Code provides incentives for commercial projects in certain circumstances. Applicability: Projects with zone lots ½ mile of a rail transit station platform, using the general or shopfront building form and are located in an C-RX, C-MX or C-MS zone district or is within a D-C, D-TD, D-GT, or D-AS zone districts AND are a non-residential structure (meaning that the primary residential uses are less than 50% or less of the gross floor area, excluding parking) may pay 2 times the linkage fee for the entirety of the project and may develop to the maximum height with incentives set forth in the applicable building form table or section within Article 8 (PDF, 25MB) for the downtown districts. Example of a Commercial Development Accessing Incentives A commercial project in the D-GT zone district has a base floor area ratio (FAR) of 8.0. If the applicants want to build from 8.1 to the maximum of 15.0 FAR, they must pay two times the applicable linkage fee at the time of building permit. If they applied for a building permit in December of 2023 and opted to build to 12 FAR, they would pay a fee of $10.84psf (fee of $5.42X 2) for the entire development (excluding parking). Exceptions The following exceptions to the linkage fee may be submitted, and they can be found in the Denver Revised Municipal Code Sec. 27-154. The required documentation at time of site development plan (SDP) is provided below. Exceptions must be approved prior to SDP approval. Reductions and Waivers The Expanding Housing Affordability ordinance requires the payment of a linkage fee for all new development except new residential development of 10 or more units that is subject to the mandatory affordable housing requirement. The Executive Director of the Department of Housing Stability may reduce or waive the amount of the linkage fees that would otherwise be imposed. Any applicant requesting a reduction or waiver must demonstrate that the required fee exceeds the amount needed to mitigate the actual demand for affordable housing created by the development. Request a reduction or waiver (coming soon) About the Affordable Housing Fund Denver's housing costs, both for-rent and for-sale, have risen dramatically since 2010. Even with robust construction, Denver's supply of housing is unable to keep pace with demand. The community asked the city to address the struggle faced by 1/3 of Denver households that are housing cost-burdened (paying more than one-third of their monthly income on housing) by establishing a dedicated fund. The housing fund is used to create and preserve housing for households across a wide income spectrum. The fund will support permanent housing and supportive services for at-risk residents, low- and moderate-income workforce rental housing, and moderate-income for-sale housing. Read the City Council ordinance establishing the affordable housing fund Visit Denver's Affordable Housing Fund page for more information. Linkage Fee - Prior to July 1, 2022 The linkage fee went into effect in 2017 as one funding source of a dedicated affordable housing fund in Denver. The affordable housing fund is used to create and preserve thousands of affordable homes for low-to-moderate income families. The Expanding Housing Affordability ordinance became effective July 1, 2022 and increases linkage fees for certain development types. To find out if your project is exempt from the Expanding Housing Affordability ordinance linkage fee schedule, view the ordinance's effective dates . If your project is exempt from the Expanding Housing Affordability ordinance linkage fee schedule, you will still pay the linkage fee as determined by the previous fee schedule (that is subject to inflation-adjusted increases), or submit an exception. *Linkage fees are due prior to issuance of a building permit, except in cases of excavation and shoring. Fee schedule Fee Schedule Prior to July 1, 2022 Some development projects may be exempt from linkage fee amount increases under the Expanding Housing Affordability ordinance. These projects are still required to pay linkage fee amounts stipulated by the 2017 ordinance that are subject to inflation-adjusted increases. To find out if your project is exempt from the updated fee schedule, view the project effective dates . What projects does the fee apply to? Every project logging in for a building permit must document information required for compliance with Denver’s affordable housing fee. The affordable housing fee is assessed based on new gross floor area only (not including parking) and must be paid before receiving a building permit for the following: The fee does not apply to zoning or trade-specific permits (mechanical, electrical, etc.). If your project is in an existing building and is not adding any new square footage, or if you already know your project will qualify for one of the allowed exceptions from the fee, you must still submit the affordable housing fee application at log-in before receiving a fee waiver. Exceptions This table lists each exception allowed under the 2017 ordinance as well as what supporting materials are required to verify an individual exception. Any additional information listed in the table below must be received and verified by CPD prior to building permit issuance in order for the fee to be reduced or waived. Exceptions must be approved prior to SDP approval. As an alternative to the linkage fee, an applicant for a building permit has the option of including affordable housing units either on, or within a quarter-mile radius of, the subject property, according to a set formula. Application Forms & Administrative Rules and Regulations (only for projects subject to prior linkage fees) The forms below may only be used for projects subject to prior linkage fees.

Build On-Site – Baseline & Enhanced Requirements and Incentives Options for Building Affordable Homes On-Site As part of the Expanding Housing Affordability ordinance, new residential development of 10 or more units must build on-site affordable housing or meet the alternative compliance options (fee-in-lieu, negotiated alternatives). On-site building requirements and incentives are detailed in Section Sec. 27-224 of the Denver Revised Municipal Code (DRMC) and are summarized below. All incentives are by-right. Applicants may select from four build on-site requirements that vary by market area (PDF, 14MB) and tenure (rental/ownership). Projects complying with the baseline requirements receive three incentives and projects complying with the enhanced requirements receive additional incentives. Resources: Baseline Requirements and Incentives Incentives For projects providing the baseline level of affordable units to rent or to buy, the available incentives include: An Example of a Development Accessing Base Incentives A new 5-story multi-family rental development with 85 total units and 5,500 sf of street level retail is proposed on a parcel zoned G-MX-5 in a typical market. To be eligible for the base incentives, the applicant must comply with the base on-site compliance options. This applicant can either restrict 7 of the units as affordable to households earning up to 60% of Area Median Income (AMI) or 10 of the units as affordable to households earning an average of 70% AMI. If the applicant chooses to build 7 units at 60% AMI, the incentives would apply as follows: Linkage fee exemption of $15,950 = 5,500 GFA X $2.90 (note: linkage fees adjust annually) Enhanced Requirements and Incentives Projects that exceed Expanding Housing Affordability ordinance affordability requirements may be eligible for incentives beyond the baseline incentives offered in the ordinance. To qualify for enhanced incentives, a development project needs to meet or exceed the following build requirements: Incentives For projects providing the enhanced level of affordable units to rent or to buy, the available incentives include all of the base incentives PLUS: Maximum Height with Incentives in Stories and Feet An Example of a Development Accessing Enhanced Incentives A new 7-story rental multi-family residential development with 125 total units and 5,500sf of street level retail is proposed on a parcel zoned C-MX-5 in a typical market. The site is located within ¼ mile of a transit station and is neither adjacent to nor within 175-feet of a protected district. To qualify for the height incentives, the applicant must comply with the enhanced on-site compliance options. The applicant can either restrict 10 of the units as affordable to households earning up to 60% of Area Median Income (AMI), or restrict 15 of the units as affordable to households earning an average of 70% AMI. If the applicant chooses to build 15 units averaging 70% AMI, the incentives would apply as follows: Base Incentives: Enhanced Incentives: Frequently Asked Questions Do fully affordable housing projects (ex. Low Income Housing Tax Credit) qualify for the incentives? Yes, any project that meets or exceeds the Expanding Housing Affordability build-on-site requirements qualifies for the associated incentives. Fully affordable housing projects would qualify for enhanced incentives. How do protected districts impact height incentives? Protected district standards mitigate the impacts of development when it is adjacent to low-scale residential districts. These protected district standards include setbacks, stepbacks, and use limitations, in addition to maximum heights of 75-feet when within 175-feet of a protected district. If a site is within 175-feet of a protected district, the development may be limited to 75-feet and therefore not be able to access the full height incentive. See the specific zone district building form table for specific applicability . If I pay the fee-in-lieu, can I access any incentives? No, incentives are only available when building affordable units on-site. How do I calculate the minimum required number of income restricted units (IRUs)? Based on the compliance option selected and market area, an applicant should multiply the total number of units by the required percent of IRUs. For example, if a project is building 100 units, and they are building under compliance option T1-B (8% of units at 60% AMI or less), then 8 of their units must be income restricted to 60% AMI. Applicants can also use this calculator (XLSX, 37KB) to understand and compare compliance options. Rounding: In calculating the number of on-site IRUs, rounding is used such that five-tenths (0.5) or greater requires a whole unit. At least one unit must be provided if the calculation results in less than five-tenths (0.5). Ex. if a requirement is for 8.3 IRUs, the number of on-site IRUs would be eight. If a requirement is for 8.7 IRUs, the number of on-site IRUs would be nine. What are the minimum standards for the income restricted units? What is required for SDP approval? Prior to SDP approval, the applicant shall submit to HOST an executed Affordable Housing Plan (PDF, 704KB) to which the owner is committing to their appropriate compliance option and has been reviewed for alignment with the ordinance requirements and signed by HOST. How do local historic districts or landmark designations impact height incentives? Landmark Preservation reviews applications for new construction (infill) on all individual landmarks and properties within a historic district. Its design standards and guidelines ensure that any new construction is consistent with the character of the historic site or district. The Landmark Preservation Commission reviews each project individually and will determine the maximum height allowances based on the historic context. More information about the Landmark Preservation Design Review process for new infill sites is found here . Alternative Compliance Options In alignment with state law, the Expanding Housing Affordability ordinance provides alternative options to building on-site affordable housing. The alternative compliance options still contribute to affordable housing and are listed below. Fee-in-Lieu One alternative compliance option is a fee-in-lieu of building affordable units. To calculate the fee amount, developers choosing this option should first use the market area map below to determine if the project is in a typical market or a high cost market. Then, use the calculator to input the specifics of the project to calculate the fee-in-lieu amount. (More information can be found in Sec. 27-225 of the Denver Revised Municipal Code ). Market Area Map (PDF, 14MB) Compliance Option Calculator (XLSX, 37KB) Projects electing to pay the fee-in-lieu must pay the fee in full prior to issuance of a building permit, except in cases of excavation or shoring. $543,084.48 *The fee amounts will be adjusted annually for inflation. A 130-unit rental development in a typical market and under seven stories would be required to pay a total fee-in-lieu of $2,500,000: 8% unit requirement x 130 units = 10.4 units (10 units rounded to nearest tenth) 10 units x $250,000 per required affordable unit = $2,500,000 Negotiated Alternatives The negotiated alternative contributes to affordable housing needs through a negotiated agreement with the Department of Housing Stability (HOST) that better meets the goals of HOST’s Five-Year Strategic Plan , Blueprint Denver , Denver’s Comprehensive Plan , and the surrounding community. Examples of negotiated alternatives could include land dedication for new affordable housing development; fewer affordable units but restricted at a greater depth of affordability; developments providing larger layouts, more bedrooms, and family-friendly amenities; or concurrent off-site development of affordable housing. HOST is under no obligation to accept a negotiated alternative and must approve any such alternative. Terms of any negotiated alternative will bind the applicant and run with the land (the agreement will stay associated with the land regardless or ownership or development plan changes) upon approval by the director of HOST and recording with the clerk and recorded of the City and County of Denver. For more detail about Negotiated Alternatives, please see DRMC 27-226 . High-Impact Development The Expanding Housing Affordability ordinance stipulates that a ""high-impact development"" requires a tailored housing outcome informed by community outreach. Projects that qualify as High-Impact Developments must select this option in their application. High-impact development is defined as: High-Impact Developments, unless that designation is waived at the discretion of HOST, must finalize and record a high-impact development compliance plan approved by HOST. The compliance plan must demonstrate how the proposed development meets or exceeds the relevant standards set forth in the Expanding Housing Affordability ordinance for both the mandatory affordable housing requirement and the linkage fee requirement, as applicable. The compliance plan must also be informed by and responsive to a documented community engagement process. For more detail about High-Impact Developments, please see DRMC 27-229 . Exceptions to the Mandatory Affordable Housing Requirement Below are the list of exceptions to the mandatory affordable housing requirement of the Expanding Housing Affordability ordinance found in DRMC section 27-222, as well as required documentation that must be submitted to allow staff to review and confirm if the requested exception applies. Forms, Maps & Additional Resources Forms Resources Maps Which Linkage Fee Schedule Applies to my Project? Some development projects may be exempt from linkage fee amount increases under the Expanding Housing Affordability ordinance, which went into effect July 1, 2022.

C-PACE provides financing to building owners for energy efficiency. Tracy Phillips discusses how to use this financing for manufacturing and industrial buildings. The funding can bridge the gap between what they get from rebates and what they pay out-of-pocket. January 2024: Financing Energy Projects with C-PACE Rebates and financial incentives help fund energy efficiency and clean energy building upgrades. But, these rebates and incentives often don't cover the entire cost of the upgrades. This is where the Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy Program (C-PACE) comes in. The program allows building owners to pay for these upgrades with no upfront cost. C-PACE places a voluntary assessment on the property owner's tax bill. Building owners can pay for the upgrade over an extended period (up to 25 years). They can transfer the repayment obligation to a future owner if they sell the building. Join us for a discussion and Q&A session with experts from C-PACE. You'll learn more about this innovative financing opportunity. December 2023: Financing Your Project with the Colorado Clean Energy Fund Energy efficiency and clean energy upgrades in buildings can bring cost savings. Some rebates and incentives can bring down the initial investment cost. But what if these financial incentives are not enough? Watch this conversation with experts from the Colorado Clean Energy Fund. They talk about new financing options for building owners.

Do I need a permit? Any time that you are occupying or working in the Right of Way, you need a Right Of Way Permit. What does Right-of-Way mean? The public right-of-way (ROW) is an area controlled by the City for the purposes of transportation, utilities and other public infrastructure, including constructing, operating and maintaining public facilities such as streets, alleys, sidewalks, bike paths, and utilities. ROW varies in width by location and may include space between the sidewalk and property line. City Ordinances include requirements that adjacent property owners are required to maintain the adjacent ROW from the property line to the curb. What is a TCP? TCP means Traffic Control Plan.

As a service to our contractors and general public we have provided pre-approved TCP’s for residential areas on our Right of Way Street Occupancy web page (see list of Traffic Control Plans) . I'm doing work in the street - do I need to close the sidewalk? Typically you WILL need to close down the sidewalk if you are doing work in the street but it will depend on the work being done. Closing of the sidewalk is done for safety reasons for pedestrians. Sidewalk closures are REQUIRED for work such as cranes and boom trucks, concrete pumpers and excavations. Often, equipment & material staging is needed for the tree lawn or sidewalk area. What are the fees associated with closures? Just like each project is different, each closure is different.

https://www.denvergov.org/Government/Agencies-Departments-Offices/Agencies-Departments-Offices-Directory/Department-of-Transportation-and-Infrastructure/Programs-Services/Flood-Information,Flood Information,"['recycling', 'waste', 'community', 'safety']",2025-01-07T18:29:04.217984,www.denvergov.org,13231,"Flood Information Several Denver neighborhoods experience flooding during rainstorms or after very wet winters when the ground is saturated. More extreme flooding is also possible in lower-lying areas of town, and some residents are at increased risk of flooding because of their proximity to a major waterway. The city encourages all residents to be aware of flood risks and take precautions to protect their lives and property. Please use the resources below to understand your flood risk and get information on what you need to do to stay safe. Did You Receive a Flood Risk Letter from the City? Rainstorm Safety Tips Please be safe on Denver’s streets and urban trails this season! Rainstorms in Denver are common throughout the spring and summer months. It's important to remember that floods caused by rain can occur anywhere, with floodwaters rising gradually or flash floods striking suddenly. Water's powerful force can easily overtake vehicles and people. Safety Tips For Driving in Heavy Rain Safety Tips For Walking or Cycling on Urban Trails When rain is falling, it’s best not to walk or bike near a river or stream, even on Denver’s paved urban bike and walking trails; water flow can quickly increase and flooding can occur without notice. Move to higher ground and never go into a culvert! If you are on a streamside trail during a rainstorm use the alternate trail up to street level to avoid underpasses and culverts. Localized Street Flooding In some areas that are geographical low-points and underpasses, water can't be expected to disappear down the storm inlets instantly — the pace and volume of the rainfall is too quick and too great to immediately drain off. It takes time for the system to accommodate it. Neighborhood Prevention Tips What you can do to prevent flooding and keep your neighborhood clean, too Downed Power Lines/Cables Stay clear of downed lines and report them immediately to Xcel Energy at 1-800-895-1999. If a power line has fallen onto a vehicle, stay away from the vehicle. Seek help immediately by calling 911. Natural Gas Line Damage Natural gas service lines are buried throughout the city, and they can sustain damage in times of heavy rain and flooding. If you smell natural gas (the odor is similar to sulfur or rotten eggs), it may indicate a gas leak. Immediately leave your home or outside area with gas odor. Once safely outside or away from the area with the odor, call Xcel Energy at 1-800-895-2999 to report your concern. Avoid using anything that has the potential to create a spark. Do not smoke, turn on or off lights, turn on appliances, use garage door openers, start a car, or use phones in an area where gas may be present. Storm and Tree Damage Information Property owners are responsible for cleanup of debris from trees on private property and from trees within the public right-of-way adjacent to their property. (For residents on a designated parkway, the adjacent property owners are not responsible for public right-of-way trees on the parkway but would need to address trees on other streets if they live on a corner or have an alley.) Limbs on the ground are considered debris. Property owners can hire any licensed company to haul limbs away — for this type of work, the company does NOT have to be a licensed tree contractor. When a tree or limb is blocking safe access to the street or right-of-way, Denver Forestry has an on-call contractor remove the limb or tree and bills the property owner for the work. See guidelines for tree damage, emergency tree and limb removal, and lists of licensed and insured tree care contractors at denvergov.org/forestry For smaller broken branches and yard debris, see disposal and recycling options from Solid Waste Management To report significant flooding issues in Denver, please call 311 What Is My Flood Risk? Check The Flood Maps Denver Regulatory Floodplain Denver Potential Inundation Area (PIA) Mile High Flood District (MHFD) Flood Hazard Area Delineation (FHAD) FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) Terms & Definitions Flood or Flooding: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land. Floodplain: Any land area susceptible to being inundated as the result of a flood. Base Flood: Also known as “100-year flood” or ""1% annual chance flood” — A flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. The term does not imply that the flood will necessarily happen once every one hundred years. Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA): The land within a community subject to inundation by the base flood as shown on the FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM): The official map on which FEMA has delineated both the SFHA and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. Regulatory floodplain: The area of land subject to inundation by the base flood as delineated by the SFHA and any other floodplain maps that have been adopted by the City & County of Denver. These areas are regulated in accordance with the City & County of Denver Floodplain Ordinance . Potential Inundation Area (PIA): Areas where stormwater has been reported to collect in depths exceeding 12"" during storm events and where various studies have identified the potential for flooding in a major storm event. The areas depicted represent current best-available information of these hazards. PIAs are not to be confused with SFHAs. Other Common Flood Terms and Definitions (PDF, 422KB) Flood Insurance: Information For Property Owners and Renters Flood Insurance Flood insurance is required by law for any primary building with federally backed funding (e.g., mortgage or business loan) in a flood map zone with an A designation — A, AE, AH, AO, AR, and A99. In Zone X and Zone D, flood insurance is optional The City and County of Denver recommends that property owners (and renters) consider flood insurance even when it not required, especially in areas that are prone to flooding. Talk to an insurance agent who has experience with flood policies, and check out the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) website at FloodSmart.gov . For other flood insurance questions, call the FEMA Flood Insurance Hotline at 1-877-336-2627. Basic Flood Information Facts The City and County of Denver participates in the NFIP Community Rating System (CRS) program which rewards our stormwater and floodplain management efforts by offering flood insurance discounts to certain policyholders. The City and County of Denver is currently a CRS Class 6 (20% discount) effective April 1, 2023 . (Previously it was CRS Class 7, 15% discount.) CRS discounts are available to all flood insurance policyholders. NFIP Policyholder Information NFIP Policyholder Letters Beginning in 2017, policyholders will receive annual letters from the Federal Emergency Management Agency as notification that a review of their property's flood risk has been done. FEMA Letters: Flood Risk and Policy Options Special Flood Hazard Area Zones Zone A Subject to 1% annual chance flooding. No base flood elevations determined. Zone AE Subject to 1% annual chance flooding. Base flood elevations determined. Zone AE Floodway (cross hatched) The floodway is the channel of a stream plus any adjacent floodplain areas that must be kept free of encroachment so that the 1% annual chance flood can be carried without substantial increases in flood heights. Zone AH Subject to 1% annual chance flooding. Base flood elevations determined. Flood depths of 1 to 3 feet usually in areas of ponding. Zone AO Subject to 1% annual chance flooding.  Base flood elevations determined.  Flood depths of 1 to 3 feet usually sheet flow on sloping terrain. Zone AR This is an area that was formerly protected from the 1% annual chance flood event by a flood control system that was subsequently decertified, and is currently in the process of being restored to provide protection from the 1% annual chance or greater flood event. Zone A99 This is an area to be protected from the 1% annual chance flood event by a Federal flood protection system under construction; no base flood elevations determined. Other Flood Areas Shaded Zone X Areas of 0.2% annual chance flood; areas of 1% annual chance flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with drainage areas less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by levees from a 1% annual chance flood. Unshaded Zone X Areas determined to be outside the 0.2% annual chance floodplain. Zone D Areas in which flood hazards are undetermined, but possible. Flood Map Changes in Denver: Are You Affected? Flood Map Updates Flood risk changes over time due to natural and man-made changes. The corresponding flood maps are revised periodically to reflect these changes and to improve map accuracy using better data and technology. The City and County of Denver works with MHFD and FEMA to study flood risk and update flood maps. Major Flood Map Revisions (""Physical Map Revision"" or PMR) A PMR is a FEMA process that is used for large changes to the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and are commonly used to incorporate MHFD Flood Hazard Area Delineation (FHAD) studies into the FEMA FIRMs. Minor Flood Map Revisions (called ""Letter of Map Change"" or LOMC) If you live in an area that is under revision Flood Safety Denver Office of Emergency Management Emergency Preparedness MHFD Flood Safety FEMA's Ready.gov National Weather Service Red Cross Resources for Homeowners and Business Owners Drainage Complaints or Maintenance Requests In Denver, contact 311 or report an issue online For properties in the floodplain Construction & Remodeling In general, most construction within the floodway is prohibited.

This new program replaces the Temporary Outdoor Dining Program, which the City created during the pandemic to allow businesses to safely remain open by expanding service in the public right-of-way. The Outdoor Places Program formalizes some of the flexibilities that were granted to businesses under the emergency Temporary Outdoor Dining Program and introduces a new coordinated permitting process. Program Requirements, application details and other information can be found on the program webpage . What's changing? What comes next for TCR permitholders? TCR permitholders who renewed their permits in spring 2023 are permitted until they expire February 28, 2024. After which, applicants must re-apply under the Outdoor Places Program.

Baseline renewal – If an applicant is renewing a former TCR permit and making no changes to the previously permitted patio, they only need to submit an OP application in E-permits. The existing patio will be approved as is unless there are significant inconsistencies with the Outdoor Places Program design guidelines. These will be handled on a case-by-case basis. Design changes – If an applicant has decided to modify their patio to incorporate elements from the Outdoor Places Program design guidelines, they will need to submit an OP application in E-permits and will need full compliance with the Outdoor Places Program Requirements and complete a full review.

Transit Amenity Program Bench, Shelter and Kiosk - DOTIPT-120.0 Reference Number: DOTIPT-120.0 Last Modified: 8/1/2024 Documentation: Annual Permit Information The objective of the transit amenity program is to improve the city’s streetscape and improve existing bus stop amenities. It permits private vendors to install new advertising shelters, kiosks and city standard benches at bus stops. Less appealing advertising benches will be removed when other amenities are available for those locations. For each shelter and kiosk a vendor installs, they will be required to install a certain number of city standard benches at different bus stop locations. Source/Authority: Ordinance No. 466, Series of 2001 authorizes bus shelters and kiosks bearing advertising in the public right of way, adopted by council in June 2001. Permits are required of any vendor and/or organization that installs an amenity at a bus stop (this includes RTD). These are annual, revocable permits. No city funding is needed for this program. Private vendors fund the purchase of the amenities as well as site improvements, including concrete pads at the stop if no pad exists, and regular maintenance. If you observe problems regarding damage or maintenance of transit amenity facilities, please call 720-91-FIXIT.

While the temporary program was created in May 2020 to help restaurants and bars safely expand their serving capacity during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the permanent program allows these and other businesses to use private and public space for outdoor operations moving forward. The temporary program is no longer active. All businesses must apply through the Outdoor Places Program to operate an outdoor patio. There are four different patio types that each received their own program requirements: Above Curb Patios (public sidewalk area, tree lawns) Private Property Patios (private parking lots, privately-owned areas) Below Curb Patios (on-street parking) Full Street Closure Pilot (travel lanes) Project partners included Community Planning and Development, Denver Economic Development and Opportunity, the Denver Fire Department, the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure, Human Rights and Community Partnerships, Department of Public Health and Environment and the Department of Excise and Licenses.

Full Street Closure Pilot Click to enlarge ""Full Street Closure"" image In June 2020, Denver closed portions of some streets to traffic, including the Larimer Square block and around the Denver Pavilions. Many restaurants and bars in these spaces provided outdoor patios that extended into street travel lanes. The city heard from Denverites that they enjoyed eating, drinking, gathering, and walking and biking in these spaces free from vehicular traffic. Building on the success of these initial street closures, the Outdoor Places Street Closure Pilot aims to facilitate safe, well designed, privately maintained outdoor spaces that enhance and activate the public realm for everyone. Outdoor Places Program Status: Full Street Closure Pilot Regulations Finalized and Open for Application A full street closure constitutes a closure that blocks a single or all traffic lanes of a street for at least one block. To apply for a full street closure, the applicant must: Conduct a mobility study to understand transportation and safety impacts Conduct community outreach, respond to feedback provided, and receive neighborhood support Prioritize accessibility for individuals of all ages and abilities and better reflect the neighborhood character through design Provide street closure barricades that are flexible and decorative Read the Full Street Closure Pilot Program Requirements (PDF, 978KB) Applications must be submitted by a singular applicant that represents the whole street closure. For questions on the program requirements and application materials, please contact Justin Rinaldi, Outdoor Places Program Administrator, at Justin.Rinaldi@denvergov.org . Project Background and Resources Background Out of necessity during the pandemic, restaurants across Denver and the U.S. began to create unique outdoor spaces that turned under-utilized outdoor areas into new spaces for eating, drinking, and social gathering. As “stay at home” orders were lifted in May 2020 but capacity limits remained in place, the City and County of Denver moved quickly to create a temporary program to allow greater flexibility for these spaces – ensuring public safety while promoting fast and creative set-ups. Since May 2020, over 370 restaurants and bars have participated in the temporary program. Patrons across Denver have dined at and enjoyed these innovative outdoor spaces, and over 70% of restaurants surveyed by the Colorado Restaurant Association wanted the ability to make their temporary set-ups into a long-term space. In October 2021, Mayor Michael B. Hancock announced that Denver would begin building upon the success of these temporary measures with a permanent “Outdoor Places Program” to continue providing residents with enjoyable, safe outdoor options. Read the announcement. Scope and Timing Creating the Outdoor Places Program will include amendments to the Denver Zoning Code, which regulates private property in Denver. All zoning code amendments must be approved by Denver City Council before they can become effective. This work will also entail updates to city rules and regulations governing the use of the public right-of-way. Existing approved temporary patios in good standing (meaning that renewals are on time and the patios are meeting the requirements of the permit) will be allowed to remain into 2023 as city staff work with businesses and residents to develop new rules for the permanent program.

Criteria/limits for using parking lanes and travel lanes for outdoor business will be established to ensure the safety of all. While the Outdoor Places Program itself will be permanent, right-of-way permits are always temporary and revocable to allow the city to react to changing conditions in the right-of-way. Temporary Program Deadlines Above Curb Patios (public sidewalks, tree lawns) Above curb patios in good standing could continue in place through April 30, 2023, or longer if an extension was granted by the city. To continue beyond April 2023, businesses needed to apply under the Outdoor Places Program by April 30, 2023. Businesses were able to operate under the temporary permit beyond April 30, 2023 while the Outdoor Places application was reviewed. Above Curb patio requirements and application>> Please note that the program requirements differ from those of the temporary program, so business owners should read these requirements carefully. The Outdoor Places Program replaces the Department of Transportation & Infrastructure's Tables, Chairs & Railings (TCR) program. Business owners with a TCR permit do not need to take further action at this time. Private Property Patios (private parking lots, privately-owned areas) Private property patios operated under the temporary program that were in good standing could continue in place through December 31, 2023. To continue operating a private property patio beyond December 2023, businesses needed to apply for a zoning permit under the Outdoor Places Program, including payment of all applicable fees, by October 31, 2023, and be fully permitted by March 31, 2024. Apply for an Outdoor Gathering Area Zoning Permit Below Curb Patios (on-street parking) Below curb patios that were in good standing could continue in place through February 28, 2024. To continue annually beyond February 2024, businesses needed to apply under the Outdoor Places Program by February 28, 2024, and work to be fully permitted in the proceeding weeks. Pre-application meetings with the city were required prior to the February 28th application deadline. If you have a liquor license, you will also need to submit a request for a permanent modification with the Department of Excise and Licenses. Street Closure Pilot (travel lanes) Below curb patios that close a travel lane or the full block were permitted to operate through December 31, 2023 if they were in good standing. To continue operating into 2024, these outdoor spaces needed to submit a Pilot Street Closure application for review, which allows the temporary closure to remain operating until a decision on the application has been made. Review of these applications prioritize facilitating safe, well designed, privately maintained outdoor spaces that enhance and activate the public realm for everyone. Contact For questions regarding the temporary patio program, please contact: Justin Rinaldi, Outdoor Places Program Administrator Community Planning & Development Justin.Rinaldi@denvergov.org Right-of-Way Permit Fee and Economic Analysis An Outdoor Places permit fee and other applicable fees are required for all outdoor patios located within the right-of-way. Fee amounts are determined based on the location and size of the patio and whether the permit is for a new location or an annual renewal.
